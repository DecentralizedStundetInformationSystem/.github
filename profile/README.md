# Decentralized Student Information System

This organization serves as the central hub for my project, which uses blockchain technology to manage and access student information.

## What is DSIS?
The Decentralized Student Information System (DSIS) is a blockchain-based application for student information management. By leveraging the power of decentralized technology, DSIS ensures transparent and secure storage of student data, while providing functionalities such as enrollment, term management, course evaluation, and attendance tracking. 

DSIS consists of three main components: a server, a desktop application for administrators and staff, and a mobile application for students.

## Repository Overview

This organization contains the following repositories:

- [Server](https://github.com/DecentralizedStundetInformationSystem/DSIS_Server): This repository houses the server implementation responsible for handling blockchain operations. It ensures secure and transparent management of student data through decentralized technology.

- [Desktop Application](https://github.com/DecentralizedStundetInformationSystem/DSIS_Admin): The desktop application provides a user-friendly interface for administrators and staff members to efficiently manage student information. Student information that will be written on the blockchain is sent through this application.

- [Mobile Application](https://github.com/DecentralizedStundetInformationSystem/DSIS_DApp): The mobile application is designed specifically for students, allowing them to access their personal information securely from their mobile devices. It offers features like grades, attendance tracking, and other relevant information.

## Getting Started
